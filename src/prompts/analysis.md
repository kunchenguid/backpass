You are auditing one past agent session against the repository's agent memory file.

Your job is NOT to review the code. It is to measure how well the memory file's
instructions actually steered this session, and to spot mistakes an instruction could
have prevented. This is the loss signal for a backward pass over the memory file.

## The memory file under audit: {{MEMORY_PATH}}

Each instruction has a stable id in [brackets]. Refer to instructions ONLY by these ids.

{{INSTRUCTION_INDEX}}

## The distilled session trace

Tool calls are one-line summaries and tool output is truncated. The raw transcript path
is at the end of the trace: open it ONLY if a specific claim you want to make cannot be
verified from the distilled trace. Reading it is allowed but costs time, so do not do it
by default. Set `usedRawTranscript` accordingly.

{{TRACE}}

## What to report

Return ONE JSON object and nothing else. No prose before or after, no markdown fence.

```
{
  "positive":  [{"instruction": "AG-042", "moment": "turn 12", "effect": "what following it achieved", "quote": "verbatim text from the trace"}],
  "negative":  [{"instruction": "AG-017", "moment": "turn 3",  "effect": "what going against it cost", "quote": "verbatim text from the trace"}],
  "gaps":      [{"mistake": "what went wrong", "proposedInstruction": "one sentence that would have prevented it", "recurrenceRisk": "high|medium|low", "quote": "verbatim text from the trace"}],
  "usedRawTranscript": false
}
```

Rules, in order of importance:

1. **Every item needs a verbatim `quote` copied exactly from the trace.** Items without
   a real quote are discarded downstream, so an unquotable claim is wasted work.
2. **Negative evidence is the most valuable.** A visible violation, misreading, or
   ignored instruction outranks a dozen "it went fine" observations.
3. **Do not confabulate influence.** Only call something positive when the trace shows
   the agent doing the specific thing the instruction asks for. An outcome that would
   have happened anyway is not evidence.
4. `gaps` are mistakes NOT covered by any current instruction. If an instruction exists
   and was ignored, that is `negative`, not a gap.
5. `proposedInstruction` must be one imperative sentence, specific enough to act on and
   general enough to apply beyond this one session.
6. An empty array is a valid and useful answer. Report nothing rather than something weak.
